# Changelog

This document will contain a chronological list of all notable changes made to Clicked.

The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). The versioning scheme used is [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), the notable breakpoints of what defines a major, minor, or patch version are as follows:

* The MAJOR component is only used ceremonially and will likely not be incremented unless a significant rewrite happens that does not have backwards compatibility.
* The MINOR component is used whenever a version has backwards-compatible profile changes. This also indicates that the user can not switch back to a previous MINOR version without using a backup.
* The PATCH component is used for versions that do not contain profile format changes. Users can freely switch between PATCH versions without risk of data loss.
